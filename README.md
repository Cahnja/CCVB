Cahn, Cahn, Venderbush, Burke Final Project

DEPLOYED: http://softdev-server.stuycs.org:5665/
Functionality: Fully-functional

Chris (pd.7) David (pd.6) Jack (pd.7) Sweyn (pd.6)

Front-end: Chris

 Project Description: 

1. The user types in a word or phrase and received some sort of positive/negative rating of that word or phrase based on the types of things being said about it on Facebook and Twitter, as well as a list of some of the words most commonly used with it, and some sort of rating of how much people are talking about it. This could possibly be extended to have the user be able to input their own tweet or facebook post and see what kind of reaction people might have to it. We'll of course be using the facebook and twitter APIs to get the data. As for analyzing the data, we'll have to see, but one possibility is Python's NLTK. Conduct sentiment analysis. 

This could be expanded to look at the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly popularity of politicians and stocks.

2. Create better version of Klout that gives you analytics on how effective you are on social media. 

###Chris

Over Spring Break I will:
1. Finish creating a base template and background script
2. Use the template to create results pages
3. Better organize the front page (real buttons, left and right sections, short descriptions of the two searches)
4. Most likely resort to using Bootstrap

###Jack

I can spend an hour a night on this project

Week of April 7: Get V1 of Twitter Query Working

###Sweyn

Currently experimenting with authenticating with/how much data we can pull out of the public Facebook Graph API without authenticating

###David

I will be working on the Twitter and Instagram implementation, primarily on generating data about popularity of individuals/organizations.

I will work 1-2 hours nightly in addition to massive chunks on weekends (making this project awesome is a priority). 

Due 3/28: Authenticate and pull as much data as possible from Twitter and Instragram APIs
