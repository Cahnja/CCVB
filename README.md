Cahn, Cahn, Venderbush, Burke Final Project

Chris (pd.7) David (pd.6) Jack (pd.7) Sweyn (pd.6)

Leader: TBD

Front-end: Chris

Tentative Project Description: 

1. The user types in a word or phrase and received some sort of positive/negative rating of that word or phrase based on the types of things being said about it on Facebook and Twitter, as well as a list of some of the words most commonly used with it, and some sort of rating of how much people are talking about it. This could possibly be extended to have the user be able to input their own tweet or facebook post and see what kind of reaction people might have to it. We'll of course be using the facebook and twitter APIs to get the data. As for analyzing the data, we'll have to see, but one possibility is Python's NLTK. Conduct sentiment analysis. 

This could be expanded to look at the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly popularity of politicians and stocks.

2. Create better version of Klout that gives you analytics on how effective you are on social media. 

###Chris

I'll probably spend about an hour each on Wednesday night and Thursday night setting up a skeleton for the user interface.

###Jack

I can spend an hour a night on this project

###Sweyn

Currently experimenting with authenticating with/how much data we can pull out of the public Facebook Graph API without authenticating
